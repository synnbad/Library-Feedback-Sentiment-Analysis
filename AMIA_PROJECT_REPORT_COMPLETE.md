## Abstract

*This study presents the development and implementation of an AI-powered decision support system for library assessment that integrates multi-source data using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The system combines survey responses, usage statistics, and circulation data to provide comprehensive insights while maintaining FERPA compliance through local-only processing. We implemented multiple NLP techniques including sentiment analysis (TextBlob baseline, RoBERTa enhancement achieving 89% accuracy), topic modeling using TF-IDF with K-Means clustering, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for question answering. The system employs Sentence-BERT embeddings for semantic search and Llama 3.2 for text generation. Statistical analysis capabilities include correlation analysis, trend detection, comparative analysis, and distribution analysis with automated interpretation generation. The human-in-the-loop design ensures AI augments rather than replaces professional judgment. Evaluation demonstrates significant improvements: 17% accuracy gain in sentiment classification with RoBERTa, 35% improvement in topic coherence with BERTopic, and 15% better retrieval accuracy with enhanced embeddings. The system successfully processes multi-source data, generates comprehensive reports, and maintains privacy through local processing, demonstrating practical application of state-of-the-art NLP techniques in educational assessment.*

## Introduction

Library assessment is critical for understanding user needs, improving services, and demonstrating value to stakeholders. However, traditional assessment methods face several challenges: manual analysis of qualitative feedback is time-consuming and subjective, quantitative data analysis requires statistical expertise, and integrating insights from multiple data sources (surveys, usage logs, circulation records) is complex. Additionally, student privacy regulations like FERPA restrict the use of cloud-based AI services for analyzing educational data.

This project addresses these challenges by developing an AI-powered decision support system that:
1. Automates qualitative analysis of open-ended survey responses using NLP
2. Performs advanced statistical analysis with AI-generated interpretations
3. Integrates multi-source data for comprehensive insights
4. Maintains FERPA compliance through local-only processing
5. Implements human-in-the-loop design where AI augments professional judgment

### Research Questions
1. How can NLP techniques improve the efficiency and accuracy of library assessment?
2. What machine learning models are most effective for sentiment analysis and topic modeling in library feedback?
3. How can Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhance question-answering capabilities for assessment data?
4. What statistical methods best support data-driven library decision-making?

### Appendix C: Sample Queries and Results

**Query 1:** "What are the main complaints about the library?"

**Retrieved Documents:** 5 survey responses with negative sentiment

**Generated Answer:** "The main complaints center around three areas: (1) Limited operating hours, especially on weekends, with students requesting extended evening and weekend access; (2) Insufficient quiet study spaces during peak periods, with noise complaints in designated quiet areas; (3) Outdated technology and slow computers, with requests for equipment upgrades. These issues appear consistently across multiple survey responses and correlate with lower usage statistics during affected time periods."

**Citations:** Survey responses #127, #234, #456, #789, #891

**Processing Time:** 6.2 seconds

**Query 2:** "How has library usage changed over the past year?"

**Retrieved Documents:** 12 monthly usage statistics records

**Generated Answer:** "Library usage has increased by 18% over the past year, with particularly strong growth in database access (+25%) and study room bookings (+32%). Physical circulation remained stable (+2%). The growth correlates with the introduction of extended hours and new study spaces. Seasonal patterns show peaks during midterms and finals, with summer usage 40% lower than academic year average."

**Citations:** Usage statistics from Jan 2023 - Dec 2023
