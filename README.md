# Library Assessment Decision Support System

An AI-augmented assessment tool that helps library professionals analyze patron feedback, usage patterns, and service effectiveness through a **human-in-the-loop** approach. The system combines quantitative and qualitative analysis with natural language querying to support data-driven decision-making while keeping humans at the center of the assessment process.

## Overview

This system is designed to **augment, not replace** human expertise in library assessment. It provides:

- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Combine survey responses, usage statistics, circulation data, and other sources for comprehensive analysis
- **Cross-Dataset Insights**: Identify patterns and relationships across different data sources
- **Intelligent Analysis**: AI-powered insights that synthesize information from multiple datasets
- **Natural Language Interaction**: Ask questions that span multiple data sources and get unified, contextual answers
- **Human-Centered Workflow**: All AI-generated insights are presented as recommendations for human review and validation
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Every answer includes citations and confidence scores so you can verify the analysis
- **Local Processing**: Complete data privacy with no external API calls - your data never leaves your infrastructure

See USER_GUIDE.md for detailed format specifications.

## Multi-Source Integration Examples

The system is designed to integrate and analyze data from multiple sources simultaneously:

### Example 1: Satisfaction + Usage Correlation
- Upload survey data with satisfaction scores
- Upload usage statistics with visit counts
- Run correlation analysis to identify if satisfaction correlates with usage
- Generate insights: "Higher satisfaction scores are associated with increased program attendance"

### Example 2: Cross-Branch Comparison
- Upload circulation data from multiple branches
- Upload survey responses by branch
- Compare performance across locations
- Identify best practices: "Branch A has higher satisfaction - what are they doing differently?"

### Example 3: Temporal Pattern Analysis
- Upload monthly usage statistics over 2 years
- Upload quarterly survey responses
- Analyze trends across both datasets
- Forecast future needs: "Usage is increasing but satisfaction is declining - capacity issue?"

### Example 4: Service Impact Assessment
- Upload pre-program and post-program survey data
- Upload usage statistics before and after service changes
- Perform comparative analysis
- Measure impact: "New hours increased usage by 25% and satisfaction by 15%"

### Example 5: Comprehensive Assessment
- Combine survey responses, circulation data, program attendance, and digital resource usage
- Ask: "What factors most influence patron satisfaction?"
- System analyzes correlations across all datasets
- Generate holistic recommendations based on multi-source insights

The RAG query engine automatically searches across all uploaded datasets to provide comprehensive answers grounded in your complete data landscape.

## Data Privacy & Compliance

## Human-in-the-Loop Philosophy

This system is designed around the principle that **AI should augment human expertise, not replace it**:

### AI as Assistant, Not Authority
- All AI-generated insights are presented as **recommendations** for human review
- Statistical interpretations include confidence levels and limitations
- Citations and source data are always provided for verification
- Professional librarian judgment remains central to decision-making

### Transparency & Explainability
- Every AI response includes citations to source data
- Statistical methods and assumptions are clearly explained
- Confidence scores help you assess reliability
- Complete audit trail of all analyses and queries

### Validation Workflow
1. **AI Analyzes**: System processes data and generates insights
2. **Human Reviews**: You examine results, check citations, validate against context
3. **Human Decides**: You make final decisions based on AI insights + your expertise
4. **System Documents**: All decisions and rationale are logged for accountability

### When to Trust AI vs. Human Judgment
- **Trust AI for**: Pattern detection, statistical calculations, large-scale text analysis, citation retrieval
- **Trust Humans for**: Contextual interpretation, policy decisions, stakeholder communication, ethical considerations
- **Best Together**: AI finds patterns, humans determine meaning and action

## Security & Best Practices

### Initial Setup
- Change default admin password immediately after first login
- Store database file (`data/library.db`) securely with appropriate file permissions
- Regularly backup data directory to prevent data loss
- Review access logs in `access_logs` table periodically

### Operational Security
- All data processing happens locally - no external API calls
- PII detection runs automatically on all text inputs and outputs
- Audit trail captures all data access and analysis operations
- User authentication required for all system access

### Data Governance
- Document data sources and provenance in FAIR/CARE metadata
- Review and validate AI-generated insights before acting on them
- Maintain ethical considerations documentation for sensitive datasets
- Follow your institution's data retention and deletion policies
